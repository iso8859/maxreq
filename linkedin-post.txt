Which Programming Language Delivers the Fastest API Performance?


This new testing session of maxreq has been done on an OVHcloud VPS. This is incredible the difference between the first and last one.


Rust is x6 time more performant than Python.

C#, more easy language than Rust is x5.7 faster.


If you want performance for your API please stop using Python and PHP.


Multi-Language API Server Performance Comparison.


Context : compare API server performance for simple database requests.

I'm talking about web development, only API.


Using AI, I created 8 identical API projects along with a benchmark client to evaluate the request-handling capacity of each server. The test scenario benchmarks a POST request with JSON payload and JSON response, simulating a small identification payload. Each request triggers a SQLite query to retrieve the corresponding data.


The server specs are: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 cores, 16 threads) running Windows 10.


Results for 100,000 requests with 16 concurrent connections:

  Rust: 18,563 req/s – Zero-cost abstractions deliver maximum speed

  Go: 12,694 req/s – Excellent balance of performance and simplicity

  C# - Minimal API: 7,401 req/s – Lean hosting model

  C# - Controller: 6,508 req/s – Conventional MVC style

  C++: 5,920 req/s – Fast but not recommended for web APIs

  Java: 3,235 req/s – JVM optimization, but heavier stack here

  Python: 4,564 req/s – FastAPI with multi-workers performs well

  Node.js: 2,382 req/s – V8 event loop solid, but single-threaded per worker

  PHP (CGI): 2,072 req/s – Traditional model, limited concurrency realism


This shows a performance disparity of up to ~9x depending on the technology choice.

Production costs will be significantly higher due to lower throughput. 

Is it justifiable to choose technologies that consume more resources for the same functionality? 

Consider the reduction in server count possible with higher-performance alternatives.


With today’s AI tools, migrating functionality between technologies is becoming easier.
