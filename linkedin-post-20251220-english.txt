Which Programming Language Delivers the Fastest API Performance?

I benchmarked 12 different implementations of the same API (POST request with database query) to measure real-world I/O performance. Here are the results:

📊 Performance Rankings (requests/second):
• Node.js PM2: 3,823
• Python Unicorn: 4,192
• Java Spring: 6,721
• PHP-FPM: 8,010
• Java Minimal: 10,993
• Go: 12,271
• C# Controller: 14,465
• Rust Tokio: 17,910
• C# Minimal API: 18,140
• Rust Actix: 23,701
• Node.js (uWebSockets): 24,364
• C++ (uWebSockets): 34,404

Key Findings:

C++ is 9x faster than Node.js (traditional setup) and 8x faster than Python. As a senior C++ developer, I must acknowledge that the uWebSockets library made this performance possible—I wouldn't achieve this level by myself.

C# is 7.5x faster than Node.js and offers the best compromise between code simplicity, maintenance, and performance. It runs everywhere with one codebase.

Rust showed surprisingly poor results compared to expectations. If someone implements the same socket optimization as uWebSockets, performance will improve significantly.

Node.js with uWebSockets library (thanks to David Grelaud's expertise) achieves near-Rust performance by leveraging C++ libraries directly from JavaScript code.

Important Considerations:

The processor and OS matter significantly. I got very different results between Debian 12/13 and Windows, and between AMD and Intel processors.

Docker is a performance killer, especially with Java.

Monoprocess platforms (C++, Rust, Java, C#, Go) have an advantage: no need for Redis to cache information between threads—better performance and lower costs.

My Recommendations:

For large projects needing performance: C# (.NET)
For maximum performance: C++ with uWebSockets (but not recommended for APIs due to complexity)
For simplicity with good performance: Node.js or C#
Avoid for performance-critical APIs: Python and PHP

If you need Python for AI, consider https://aspire.dev: C# backbone with Python workers.

Test Environment: OVHcloud VPS-2, 6 vCore, 12 GB RAM, Debian, SQLite database with 10,000 users.

The full benchmark code and detailed results are available on my GitHub repository.

Stop building "high-performance APIs" with Python. Choose the right stack, save time, achieve better performance, and keep your team happy.
