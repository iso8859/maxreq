Which Programming Language Delivers the Fastest API Performance?

Rust is 15x faster than Node.js.

I agree, Rust is not the simplest programming language.

C# is 13x faster than Node.js, and .NET is very accessible.

I ran all these tests after seeing so many job offers claiming "building a top team to deliver super performant APIs with Python or Node.js".

Please stop that. This is not true. Saying that is like running a decathlon with stones in your shoes.

I also spent some time comparing different JVMs, both in Docker and without Docker.

Comparing Java Native vs Java in Docker => You lose a lot of performance using Docker.

Be smart, choose the right stack, and please stop using Python and Node.js for APIs!

You will save time, achieve better performance, and keep your team happy.
